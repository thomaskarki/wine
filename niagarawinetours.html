        <h1>Niagara Grapes</h1>
        <img src="images/images150/grapes150.png" alt="Niagara Grapes">

        <p>
          Niagara grapes are a variety of the North American grape species 
          Vitis labrusca (botanical family Vitaceae) and are used as table 
          grapes and for wines, as well as jams and juice. Niagara is the 
          leading green grape grown in the United States. A purple variety, 
          known as "pink" niagara (niagara rosada), exists and is the main 
          niagara cultivated in southern Brazil, principally in the states 
          of Sao Paulo, where the variety first occurred in 1933, and Rio 
          Grande do Sul. The Niagara grape was created in Niagara County, 
          New York, in 1868 when Claudius L. Hoag and Benjamin W. Clark 
          cross-bred Concord grapes with white Cassady grapes. It was first 
          sold commercially in 1882. Niagara grapes are considered to be poor 
          shipping grapes, and so are usually only found near where they 
          are grown. They are most commonly found in the United States in 
          New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Washington, and 
          Ohio, and are also grown in Ontario in Canada, as well as in Brazil, 
          and New Zealand. While only rarely available fresh outside these 
          areas, Niagara grapes are well known to most American consumers as 
          the source of most white grape juice.

        <p>
          The fresh grape is large and juicy, round to oval-shaped, pale 
          greenish-white in color and has a sweet, very pleasant aroma. 
          It also has a sweet and generally pleasant flavor, sometime being 
          described as "foxy". One reviewer, Paul Bulas, attempted to 
          characterize the "foxy" description. In analyzing the Niagara grape, 
          he detected aromas like candied lemon rind, a Riesling-like diesel 
          aroma, flowery jasmine-like notes, and what he called "a high-toned, 
          candied muskiness." This latter descriptor he felt was the primary 
          element of the term "foxy". His opinion of wines made with the grape 
          is that they have unique and interesting properties that are not 
          well known due to Niagara's reputation as a less-than-optimum wine 
          grape. A diesel aroma in wine is considered to be a positive attribute, 
          but it can be excessive in wines made with the Niagara grape. One 
          opinion is that Niagara grape skins should not contact the must for 
          too long a time after pressing to avoid an excess of this characteristic.
